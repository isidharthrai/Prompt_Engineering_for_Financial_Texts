  1. The company is *growing* in Russia, indicating a successful market expansion.  
  2. By stating it has *no plans to move all production* there, management signals a cautious approach to geopolitical risk (sanctions, supply‑chain disruptions), which investors often view as prudent risk management.  
  3. Maintaining diversified production locations can protect earnings stability.

*Evidence supporting a positive view*  
- The statement explicitly says “delivery volumes and selling prices showed favourable development.”  
- “Comparable net sales grew by **50 % year‑on‑year** to EUR 647 m” – a very strong top‑line growth figure.  
- The comment is attributed to the CEO, which often signals confidence from management.  

*Evidence contradicting a positive view*  
- No mention of profitability, margins, cash‑flow or guidance, so the growth could be margin‑dilutive (e.g., driven mainly by price hikes).  
- The phrase “favourable development” is vague; investors may wonder whether the growth is sustainable.

- **Evidence supporting positivity**  
  1. Operating profit rose from €4.14 mn to €15.86 mn – a ~283 % increase YoY, which signals strong earnings growth.  
  2. The phrase “up from” is a clear upward‑trend indicator, commonly interpreted as good news for shareholders.
